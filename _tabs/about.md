Since I was a little little kid, robots and moving machines were my passion. Building cardboard box robots and being amazed by my dad's convertible car, yelling "transformer" at it each time the top would pop out of the back, robotics seemed more like a destiny than a degree for me to pursue. I got extremely lucky and got to study it as well. Thank you mom, thank you dad.

Fast forward 10 years, at the age of 10, I was living in Brazil were I got to join the Robotics team at the Mackenzie School, in Brasilia. We would compete on all kinds of events (Rescues, races, First Lego League, RoboCup style events, etc) and at 12 years old, we travelled to Mexico city to represent Brazil in the Robocup Rescue B Junior worldchampionship. We won the superteam cathegory :)

Current Head of Software Engineering at DPhi Space. A passionate robotics enthusiast with strong engineering skills and proven leadership.
